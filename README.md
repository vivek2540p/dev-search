             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '5432',
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **(Optional) Create a superuser:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
